Skipping around a bit in the order of things, we have [Tenchi Muyou! Game Hen](https://superfamicom.org/info/tenchi-muyou-game-hen/ "Tenchi Muyou! Game Hen (Japan) (Sample)") (Japan) (Sample). This is somewhere between the sample it labels itself and an early beta. The cartridge label as 40% complete, and it's clearly that early.  The ROM itself has the internal title of [MAHOUJIN GURUGURU](https://superfamicom.org/info/mahoujin-guru-guru/ "Mahoujin Guru Guru"), so they didn't start from scratch. I'll let the screen shots speak for themselves.

The title screens:

Who doesn't love [Super Bomberman](http://superfamicom.org/info/super-bomberman/ "Super Bomberman"), my favorite is [Super Bomberman 3](http://superfamicom.org/info/super-bomberman-3/ "Super Bomberman 3"). I didn't dig through it looking for many difference, if any. The board it came on was bad, had to swap the ROMs to a new board.

![Super Bomberman (USA) (Sample)]({% asset_path 'screenshots/super-bomberman/super-bomberman-usa-sample.0.png' %} "Super Bomberman (USA) (Sample)")
![Super Bomberman (USA) (Sample)]({% asset_path 'screenshots/super-bomberman/super-bomberman-usa-sample.1.png' %} "Super Bomberman (USA) (Sample)")
![Super Bomberman (USA) (Sample)]({% asset_path 'screenshots/super-bomberman/super-bomberman-usa-sample.2.png' %} "Super Bomberman (USA) (Sample)")

The EEPROM has this written on it:

```
1993-05-11 (Kanji?)
SUM= [3953]
```

Email me if you would like the ROM, or any of them. Too many Chinese (actually in China not a generalized term for Asian) sites are hot-linking them and generally scraping my content.

So I have time to update, nothing great but still worth while. I have for you today [Dai-3-ji Super Robot Taisen (Japan) (Rev A)](https://superfamicom.org/info/dai-3-ji-super-robot-taisen/ "Dai-3-ji Super Robot Taisen") aka [Super Robot Wars 3](https://superfamicom.org/info/dai-3-ji-super-robot-taisen/ "Super Robot Wars 3"), it's been missing for sometime now but here it is.
Nothing too great, there was a Rev B too so this didn't fix all the bugs or introduced new ones. For those like me with little to no grasp of Japanese, this game was translated long ago by [AGTP](http://agtp.romhack.net/project.php?id=srw3 "Aeon Genesis").

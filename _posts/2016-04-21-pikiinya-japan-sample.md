An interesting penguin themed puzzle game.

_Title - Final_  / _Sample_

The title is slightly different, but the logo is still animated, so that isn't aligned between the two _Title_ images.
{% include compare_local.html
    name_1='Title - Final'
    image_1='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/title.png'
    name_2='Title - Sample'
    image_2='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/title-sample.png'
%}

_Game Select 2 - Final_  / _Sample_

The first game select screen is quite different, but I'm not familiar with the game enough to know exactly what each one does.
{% include compare_local.html
    name_1='Game Select - Final'
    image_1='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/game-select-1.png'
    name_2='Game Select - Sample'
    image_2='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/game-select-1-sample.png'
%}

_Game Select 2 - Final_  / _Sample_

The second game select screen is also quite different, but again I'm not familiar with the game.
{% include compare_local.html
    name_1='Game Select - Final'
    image_1='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/game-select-2.png'
    name_2='Game Select - Sample'
    image_2='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/game-select-2-sample.png'
%}

_Player Select - Final_  / _Sample_

The player select screen is the same.
{% include compare_local.html
    name_1='Player Select - Final'
    image_1='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/player-select.png'
    name_2='Player Select - Sample'
    image_2='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/player-select-sample.png'
%}

_Name Entry - Final_  / _Sample_

The little penguin dances so he will be different, otherwise the same. There was a 3rd game select screen after this screen in the final, but not the sample.
{% include compare_local.html
    name_1='Name Entry - Final'
    image_1='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/name-entry.png'
    name_2='Name Entry - Sample'
    image_2='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/name-entry-sample.png'
%}

_Difficulty - Final_  / _Sample_

The word `easy` is spelled `eazy` in the sample, and the lettering is brighter in the sample. The top and scores are animated so they won't line up.
{% include compare_local.html
    name_1='Difficulty - Final'
    image_1='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/difficulty.png'
    name_2='Difficulty - Sample'
    image_2='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/difficulty-sample.png'
%}

_Game Play - Final_  / _Sample_

The lettering is brighter in the sample, but that was all I noticed.
{% include compare_local.html
    name_1='Game Play - Final'
    image_1='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/game-play.png'
    name_2='Game Play - Sample'
    image_2='screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/game-play-sample.png'
%}

After a soft reset there was a second title screen I couldn't get to show in the final version of the game.

![Second Title - Sample]({% asset_path 'screenshots/pikiinya-japan-sample/second-title.png' %} "Second Title - Sample")

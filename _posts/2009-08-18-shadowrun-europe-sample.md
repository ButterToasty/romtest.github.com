A quick post, [Shadowrun](http://superfamicom.org/info/shadowrun/ "Shadowrun") (Europe) (Sample), DIY to find anything different if you care enough, I have bigger Goemon fish to fry. It's still interesting the internal checksum is correct, go figure. The US version of the sample has already been floating around for who knows how long, this just makes the set a little more complete.

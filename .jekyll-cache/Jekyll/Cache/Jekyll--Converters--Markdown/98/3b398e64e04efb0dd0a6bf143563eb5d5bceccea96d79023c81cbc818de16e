I"U<p>Skipping around a bit in the order of things, we have <a href="https://superfamicom.org/info/tenchi-muyou-game-hen/" title="Tenchi Muyou! Game Hen (Japan) (Sample)">Tenchi Muyou! Game Hen</a> (Japan) (Sample). This is somewhere between the sample it labels itself and an early beta. The cartridge label as 40% complete, and it’s clearly that early.  The ROM itself has the internal title of <a href="https://superfamicom.org/info/mahoujin-guru-guru/" title="Mahoujin Guru Guru">MAHOUJIN GURUGURU</a>, so they didn’t start from scratch. I’ll let the screen shots speak for themselves.</p>

I"î<p>This is an early <a href="https://superfamicom.org/info/street-fighter-zero-2">Street Fighter Alpha 2</a> / <a href="https://superfamicom.org/info/street-fighter-zero-2">Street Fighter Zero 2 (ã‚¹ãƒˆãƒªãƒ¼ãƒˆãƒ•ã‚¡ã‚¤ã‚¿ãƒ¼ZERO 2)</a> prototype, notable due to the fact is does not yet use the special chip and is very early in development. There were several auctions sold by <a href="http://www.ebay.com/usr/safestuff1">safestuff1</a> and I bought 2 copies and decided not to buy any more after they were identical and board images were not posted and showed more final character select screens. The date on the first auction has the EEPROMs labeled with the date <code>6/11</code>, while the date from the other board is <code>9/15</code>.</p>

I"$<p>A quick post, <a href="https://superfamicom.org/info/shadowrun/" title="Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a> (Europe) (Sample), DIY to find anything different if you care enough, I have bigger Goemon fish to fry. Itâ€™s still interesting the internal checksum is correct, go figure. The US version of the sample has already been floating around for who knows how long, this just makes the set a little more complete.</p>

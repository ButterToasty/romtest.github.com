I"l<p>Time again for another brand new BS-X dump, actually 2 but they’re the same game just from two different broadcasts in the same week. It’s a really fun game, but has a limited number of start ups, so if you have this cart enjoy it while you can. This game is like Frogger meets <a href="https://superfamicom.org/info/47/" title="Lemmings">Lemmings</a>.</p>

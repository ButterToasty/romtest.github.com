I"ß<p>Itâ€™s worth noting, this is 99.9% the same as the regular The Firemen japanese game with a different header, where instead of the plain English game title there is now a Kanji version. So unless you really, really hate English letters in your internal titles, this is more of the same. Since it is really that close in size, I put it in with <a href="/the-firemen-usa-beta/" title="The Firemen (USA) (Beta) ROM">The Firemen (USA) (Beta) ROM</a> that I posted months ago.</p>

I"Û<p>A few days ago (August 15th, 2009) dejap.com sold for a few hundred dollars, and I lost. Donâ€™t visit it now, as itâ€™s a spam website, I am setting up a mirror of the old <a href="https://dejap.eludevisibility.org/" title="dejap.com">dejap.com</a> for prosperity sake. <a href="https://dejap.eludevisibility.org/" title="dejap.com">dejap.com</a> can be found here. I am working on pulling in all the old updates to the main page and relinking all the files. Thanks.</p>

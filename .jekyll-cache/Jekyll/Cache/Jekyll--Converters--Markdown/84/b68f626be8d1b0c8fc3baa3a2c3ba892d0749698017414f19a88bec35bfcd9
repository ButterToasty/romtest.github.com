I"L<p>This is a version of the game that was used at the ‘96 Tokyo Toy Fair / ‘96東京おもちゃショー and very closely resembles the Satellaview release. So closely in fact that only 1 non-header byte is different. At <code>0x04EAA0</code> the Satellaview copy has <code>0x02</code> and the Tokyo Toy Fair version has <code>0x09</code>. Both ROMs actually contain both banners, the value at <code>0x7FF4</code> controls the <code>for</code> banner image, with <code>0x00</code> being the Tokyo Toy Fair, <code>0x01</code> or any other value being the Satellaview banner. Other than that the game is the same as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sTotHZvjw8">Satellaview version</a>. The very cute <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/actagainstaids/index.html">Act Against AIDS</a> banner is present in all versions of the game.</p>

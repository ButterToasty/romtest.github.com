I"¹<p>So I have time to update, nothing great but still worth while. I have for you today <a href="https://superfamicom.org/info/dai-3-ji-super-robot-taisen/" title="Dai-3-ji Super Robot Taisen">Dai-3-ji Super Robot Taisen (Japan) (Rev A)</a> aka <a href="https://superfamicom.org/info/dai-3-ji-super-robot-taisen/" title="Super Robot Wars 3">Super Robot Wars 3</a>, itâ€™s been missing for sometime now but here it is.
Nothing too great, there was a Rev B too so this didnâ€™t fix all the bugs or introduced new ones. For those like me with little to no grasp of Japanese, this game was translated long ago by <a href="http://agtp.romhack.net/project.php?id=srw3" title="Aeon Genesis">AGTP</a>.</p>
